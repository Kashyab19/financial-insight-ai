If you are installing after a long time:
- You'd need service account credentials, ideally from Google since we are using Firebase(check .gitignore to know how the file looks like)
What do you need?
- NodeJS, MongoDB Atlas/Compass
- A Google Service Account that has DialogFlow API permissions to use the Google DialogFLow
- An API key to use OpenAI API Key
- then, do a npm i and npm run dev to run in local
